## Overview  
This project analyzes how companies are performing both **financially** and in terms of **ESG** (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standards.  
By comparing companies across industries and regions, the analysis identifies top performers, underperformers, and areas that need improvement.  
The goal is to help stakeholders understand the link between **sustainability** and **financial success**, and guide smarter, more responsible business decisions.

## What is ESG?

- **Environmental (E):** How a company protects the planet ‚Äî e.g., reducing pollution, saving energy, or using clean energy.  
- **Social (S):** How a company treats people ‚Äî e.g., employees, customers, and the wider community.  
- **Governance (G):** How a company is run ‚Äî e.g., leadership transparency, compliance, and fairness in decision-making.

## Problem Statement  

Despite growing attention on ESG, many organizations still struggle to connect sustainability with financial outcomes. This project addresses:
- Identification of high- and low-ESG performers.  
- Determination of which ESG pillars most correlate with financial success.  
- Exploration of regional and industry-wide patterns in ESG scoring.

## Objective  

To analyze the **financial** and **ESG performance** of companies across industries and regions,  
identify top and low performers, and generate actionable insights for **strategy and policy development**.

## Business Questions  

- Which companies have the highest and lowest ESG scores?  
- Are some industries better at ESG than others?  
- Which region leads in ESG performance?  
- Which ESG pillar has the strongest correlation with financial growth?  
- Has ESG performance improved over time, and how does it relate to revenue?
  
## Outlier Detection  

- Are there companies with unusually high or low **water or energy usage**, despite similar revenue levels and industry context?

## Key Findings  

- **Financial Growth:** Companies are financially stable with rising revenues and a **10.9% average profit margin**.  
- **ESG Score:** Overall ESG performance is **moderate** at 54.62 out of 100, showing room for improvement.  
- **Top Performers:** Some companies score **above 90**, demonstrating leadership in sustainability, ethics, and governance.  
- **Low Performers:** A few firms score **below 20**, putting them at future risk due to poor ESG practices.  
- **Leading Sectors:** **Finance** and **Technology** are ESG leaders.  
- **Lagging Sectors:** **Energy** and **Transportation** underperform in sustainability.  
- **Regional Insights:** **Europe** leads in ESG performance, while **Africa** and the **Middle East** score lowest, highlighting regional disparities.  
- **Resource Usage Outliers:** Companies like **Company_759**, **Company_646**, **Company_543**, and **Company_535** in the Energy sector use more energy than peers, suggesting inefficiency.  
- **Positive Trends:** ESG scores are improving gradually year over year, reflecting growing attention to sustainability and ethics.

## Recommendations  

- **Educate & Incentivize:** Provide ESG training and rewards for low-performing companies to drive behavioral change.  
- **Target Support:** Focus improvement initiatives on low-performing **industries** (e.g., Energy) and **regions** (e.g., Africa).  
- **Audit Resource Usage:** Investigate companies with excessive water/energy usage to cut costs and reduce environmental harm.  
- **Adopt Best Practices:** Encourage lagging companies to emulate high scorers through knowledge sharing and benchmarking.

## Conclusion  

This analysis confirms that **strong ESG practices** are often linked with **financial stability**.  
However, performance varies widely across sectors and regions.  
To build a **sustainable future**, companies with lower ESG scores must be supported, while top performers should serve as examples of best practice.  
Efficient resource use not only benefits the environment but also drives long-term profitability.
